# Policy Report

The algocount project seeks to contribute to concerns on the political and policy implications of the rise of algorithms. The diffusion of an Algorithmic Public Opinion specifically regards the concern that algorithmic systems disrupt previous patterns of individual and public opinion formation as well as of political participation and policy formation. Few analyses explored this phenomenon throughout a multidisciplinary comprehensive policy lens. The algocount project seeks to address this gap by discussing innovative policy approaches and proposals to the challenges of the current algorithmic public opinion. In this policy review, I firstly introduce the main algorithms, concerns
and actors involved in the algorithmic public opinion. Then, I discus the main policy approaches to the systemic challenges as well as specific proposals to the main identified algorithmic systems: recommender systems, disinformation, political microtargeting, content moderation and social bots. The ultimate goal of this analysis is to provide a critical, comprehensive and long-term oriented policy overview of the algorithmic public opinion.
