# DataSprint Activities Report
The Algocount Datasprint was held online from January 18th to 22nd, 2021. Emulating the successful approaches of the Digital Methods Initiative Schools in Amsterdam and the Smart Data Sprint in Lisbon, all the experiments were conducted using Digital Methods. The datasprint is conducted by researchers at the University of Milan, Department of Social and Political Sciences, and Density Design, Politecnico di Milano. Participants (from University of Milan and DensityDesign) have organized themselves into five sub-groups, and, as a result, the data sprint produced a total of seven single investigations, each addressing a research question. Each group had a research leader pitching the project during the first day and guiding the investigation. During the first day of work, project leaders pitched five projects focused on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Reddit, and YouTube. Participants enrolled into groups to find a balance between their skills and competencies in Communication Design and Social and Political Studies.

Here, in alphabetical order, the list of researchers participating in the Algocount Datasprint: √Ångeles Briones, Antonella Autuori, Irene Avossa, Laura Bruschi, Ludovica Corponi, Tommaso Elli, Alessandra Facchin, Emma Fortunati, Alessandro Gandini, Alessandro Gerosa, Giulia Giorgi, Beatrice Gobbo, Michele Grilli, Giovanni Lombardi, Vincenzo Luise, Michele Mauri, Andrea Elena Febres Medina, Riccardo Pronzato, Ilir Rama, Camilla Volpe.
