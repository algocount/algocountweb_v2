# PlacPlac

 Part of the Algocount research has been carried on during a data sprint to study the public perception of algorithms in society. To present the research result to a broader audience, we developed PlacPlca, a new dissemination format to store, stage, and access the results of data sprints after research activities. The format is based on a tool called Plaplac, which is part of a research project. The tool is intended as a digital place that allows researchers to expose the research process with digital methods. The tool emphasizes telling the research process, articulating the content that reinforces the use of images, visualizations, audiovisual material, among others.
