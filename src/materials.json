To present the research result to a broader audience, we developed PlacPlac, a new dissemination format to store, stage, and access the results of data sprints after research activities. The format is based on a tool called Plaplac, which is part of a research project. The tool is intended as a digital place that allows researchers to expose the research process with digital methods. The tool emphasizes telling the research process, articulating the content that reinforces the use of images, visualizations, audiovisual material, among others. \n\n","type":"read more"},{"key":1,"title":"Glitch Cards","description":"A collection of cards from algorithmic situations","imgUrl":"./cards.jpg","resUrl":"No resource url given","content":"\n# GlitchCards\n","type":"forthcoming"},{"key":5,"title":"Literature Review","description":"A literature review on the public perception of algorithms ","imgUrl":"./litreview.jpg","resUrl":"http://placplac.densitydesign.org/login","content":"\n# Literature Review\n\n","type":"forthcoming"},{"key":9,"title":"Data Sprint Reports","description":"A website collecting results of the \"Algocount Data Sprint\"","imgUrl":"./datasprints.jpg","resUrl":"No resource url given","content":"\n# DataSprint Activities Report\n","type":"forthcoming"}]
