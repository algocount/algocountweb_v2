To present the research result to a broader audience, we developed PlacPlac, a new dissemination format to store, stage, and access the results of data sprints after research activities. The format is based on a tool called Plaplac, which is part of a research project. The tool is intended as a digital place that allows researchers to expose the research process with digital methods. The tool emphasizes telling the research process, articulating the content that reinforces the use of images, visualizations, audiovisual material, among others.\n\n","type":"read more","pageName":"materials"},{"key":4,"title":"Interviews with experts","description":"A selection of interviews with researchers and experts","imgUrl":"./interviews.jpg","resUrl":"No resource url given","content":"\n# Interviews","type":"forthcoming","pageName":"materials"},{"key":3,"title":"Reporting Focus Groups","description":"Results from five focus groups carried on during Summer 2021","imgUrl":"./focusgroups.jpg","resUrl":"No resource url given","content":"# Focus Groups Report","type":"forthcoming","pageName":"materials"},{"key":5,"title":"Glitch Cards","description":"A collection of cards from algorithmic situations","imgUrl":"./cards.jpg","resUrl":"No resource url given","content":"\n# GlitchCards\nDummy text hola hola ","type":"forthcoming","pageName":"materials"},{"key":2,"title":"Literature Review","description":"A literature review on the public perception of algorithms ","imgUrl":"./litreview.jpg","resUrl":"http://placplac.densitydesign.org/login","content":"\n# Literature Review\n\n","type":"forthcoming","pageName":"materials"},{"key":7,"title":"Ideas for the algorithmic public opinion","description":"No description given","imgUrl":"./ideas.jpg","resUrl":"No resource url given","content":"\n# Ideas for the algorithmic public opinion\n","type":"forthcoming","pageName":"materials"},{"key":6,"title":"Data Sprint Results","description":"A website collecting results of the \"Algocount Data Sprint\"","imgUrl":"./datasprints.jpg","resUrl":"No resource url given","content":"\n# DataSprint Activities Report\n","type":"forthcoming","pageName":"materials"},{"key":9,"title":"Ranking Score","description":"Social Media Platforms ranked according to their policies","imgUrl":"./ranking.jpg","resUrl":"No resource url given","content":"\n# Ranking Score\n\n","type":"forthcoming","pageName":"materials"}]
